First published build of the site.
Foundations of class section and some intro text added.

--PREFACE--
Heya, /tg/. This is my second attempt at something like this, the first being the Magical Realm CYOA. I decided to use PHP and MySQL to support more dynamic content; hopefully it pans out - it's been fun to learn at any rate. If you have any tips, comments, questions, or just plain vitriol, send it to cyoafeedback@gmail.com.

--REQUIREMENTS--
A modern browser is recommended.
This site makes use of PHP and CSS.
No effort has yet been made to ensure browser compatibility.
To host the site, a PHP-supportive server and MySQL server are needed.
