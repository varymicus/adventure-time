--PREFACE--
Heya, /tg/. This is my second attempt at something like this, the first being the Magical Realm CYOA. I initially tried to use PHP and MySQL to support more dynamically generated content, but abandoned that approach for ease of coding and faster response times (client-side vs. post-back). If you have any tips, comments, questions, or just plain vitriol, send it to cyoafeedback@gmail.com.
