<div id='intro'>
<p class='narration'>
On a boring day with a heavy thunderstorm outside and nothing on the internet, a mysterious impulse draws you into ascending to your house's attic, descending to the basement, or delving into another seldom-visited place where old and strange artifacts could easily be hidden. It is here, from under a pile of other items, covered in a layer of dust, that you find an unfamiliar eldritch tome.
</p>
<p class='narration'>
When you open the book, a powerful magical light shines out and you find yourself looking at a series of incredibly detailed landscapes, people, and villains of fantasy straight from another world; a world full of adventure, mystery, and danger. The first few pages of are different: instead of pictures, they concern themselves with sheets and questions, multiple-choices and boxes to fill, with enough space for you to answer. As you do so, you find that the book imprints itself upon you, becoming yours forever and something only you can use.
<br>For this book is not a book at all, but rather a portal... and as its new owner, you have become its gatekeeper!
</p>
<p class='narration'>
Every time you open the book, you are transported into the world it contains within its pages. By default only you an anything you can carry with you may pass through, although you can expand this to other people (and by extension anything <i>they</i> can carry), if you are willing to spend the points - see below. You can get back to the real world simply by willing yourself out, although other items and people you have brought with you do not always come along, if they are too far away from you or simply do not want to. There are special cases that may temporarily block you from using this ability and lock you (or your friends) into the world until you deal with them. Under no circumstances can you ever bring anything originating from this world into our reality.
</p>
<p class='narration'>
On your first visit, the world appears similar to ours: it has a blue sky, green grass, trees, a bunch of inhabitants and wildlife, and so forth. However, the more you spend time in it and delve into its mysteries, the more different it reveals itself to be: magic is real, there are creatures and beings that should not or could not exist, laws of physics always give away to fantasy and wonder, and basically anything fathomable to human imagination is very likely to be found somewhere here. It is a world of endless adventure and excitements: whether you spend your time meeting its people and making friends, wandering across the grand landscapes and seeing sights, delving into its numerous danger-filled ruins or dungeons, or whatever else, the only thing certain of this land is that as long as you stay there, you will never grow bored or idle (unless you choose to just lie down and sleep or something).
</p>
<p class='narration'>
As the owner of the book, you are not only the master of going to this world and back, you are also given extraordinary power and skill, enough to make yourself one of its greatest living heroes. You may acquire a domain (or several) for yourself, a number of items and artifacts, friends, or even a romantic interest, based on how you answered the questions the book asked of you. As said above, none of these can follow you to the real world - but any ability or skill you have <i>will</i> remain, aside from blatantly supernatural or physics-breaking ones such as magic. As your reputation increases, people will flock to you to seek help in various problems, from trivial to deadly serious - in cases more towards the latter, there can be consequences in not helping.
</p>
<p class='narration'>
When you are not inside, the book's world continues to advance in the same time as the real world's. Likewise, when you are inside, real time keeps on going and can eventually end up with hilarity for you if you spend too much time out of it. If you die in the book, you are immediately kicked out into the real world, unharmed, while the book itself disappears, never to be seen again: any of your friends dying will not result in the book disappearing, but they can nonetheless never again go through it. Should its world be destroyed or forever corrupted beyond recognition and repair (see some of the ancient evils right at the bottom), it likewise vanishes from the real world.

<p class='narration'>
The first few pages of the book concern yourself: what do you want to be? What do you wish you knew or could do, and how would you like to improve yourself? To put it in different words, this is where you
</p>
<h1 onclick="toggleItem('classes')">Choose your class</h1>
<div id="classes">
<p class='narration'>
There are six classes for you to pick from, heroic archetypes and ideals for you to strive upon. Each of them will grant you a different set of starting equipment, tools, accessories, and clothes. Furthermore, each has three basic attributes to which you get a number of points to allocate: any skills and other abilities associated with the class are based on these three, but we only really go into detail with the magical ones - anything we do not touch upon should be brought up in your post.
</p>
<p class='narration'>
You get to allocate one to five points in each attribute: one point represents a beginner or a novice, while five is a true master, the peak of human potential. If the attribute is associated with skills, you can choose as many skills as you have points: for example, putting just one point into the Warrior's weapon skill will make you a novice with a single weapon, but putting five points has you become a grandmaster in five weapons of your choice.
</p>
<p class='narration'>
You begin with a single point in all three attributes of your primary class, after which you get nine more points to put wherever you like, up to the maximum of five. In addition, each class is close enough in function with another one that you can learn a little bit of it just by having the other class as your main: this Synergy class, though not giving you its equipment or the single starting point, allows you to allocate six points wherever you like - they max out at three, however, because another class can only teach you so much. The Warrior and Rogue classes, being so everpresent and quintessential, are the only ones that allow you to choose one out of two classes to Synergy with - one of the two being each other. Finally, all other four classes are something you have been considered to have dabbled into, as a hobby or otherwise not particularly serious; you have three points to place for each of them, up to two per attribute, simple dabbling not really giving you much real knowledge or mastery.
</p>
<p class='narration'>
Of course, though this will give you a bunch of skills and abilities to start your adventure with, you will most certainly learn more during your travels into the world: your skills will improve, your abilities increase, and occasionally even the basic attributes will grow. It is even possible to go beyond the human maximum of five, although this is of course extremely difficult (especially in the classes outside the primary), and typically requires you going on a specific quest. Ten points is the absolute maximum, however: at that point you start to surpass your humanity entirely and become godlike, and no true god of this world will allow that.
</p>
<p class='narration'>
Finally, the world around you will shape and mold itself based on your abilities, in order to give you just the right amount of challenge without becoming insurmountable or frustrating. If you are a warrior with maxed out weapon skill and physique, you will most certainly see plenty of things that require you to use your mighty physical abilities, and find a lot of magic weaponry to use. There is no way to gimp yourself: forgoing the use of firearms and going instead with a simple knife, or bare hands, or even with something blatantly ridiculous (like a yo-yo) will simply see the world react accordingly.

                You are one of this realm's greatest warriors, with very few equals in martial skill. You begin with one of each weapon you choose to be skilled in, one of which will be of moderate magical power. In addition, you can start with armor and/or shield if you like: anything from leather to plate armor and in between. Or if you choose to be skilled in modern weaponry, you can pick bullet-proof vests, riot shields, or even power armor.

                Your knowledge of mankind's most advanced science is almost without peer, in this world or the other. You begin your adventure with a number of simple tools and gadgets related to your fields of study. If you buy a Domain, however, it comes with a number of laboratories and workshops that you can put to use. In addition, thought it has been stated that the new world's laws of physics do not always function as you think they should, you will find that anything you actually have studied and know as a fact is far more solid and resistant to fluctuation - which isn't always good.

Though you cannot start with them, you can later pick up the education of a bunch of native sciences, except for magic and that kind of stuff, which is a different class altogether.

This is your mental clarity, the ability to see the cogs behind the machine to to speak, and how the physics and sciences here correlate to what you already know.

                A thief, a diplomat, and/or a spy, your cunning, persuasiveness, and stealth are second to none. In the beginning you have an expensive suit or dress, all the spy gadgets you could imagine (adjusted to the tech level you choose, of course), a few small weapons (daggers, crossbow, silenced pistol, etc.), and a sports vehicle to go around with (or a fancy wagon).

                The woodsman, beastmaster, and tracker, you're a real badass that takes no shit from anyone. Your starting equipment will depend on the desired tech level: you will begin with either a sword and a bow, leather armor, and a green sneaky cloak - or with a rifle and a pistol, a flak vest, a gas mask, and a long trenchcoat. Either way, you will also get a knife and some other basic tools to go around with.

You begin your adventure with a robe, your trusty spellbook, and a number of magical scrolls, wands, and other tools. If you start with a Domain, it comes with a library and a magical laboratory. You will also get a familiar; a cat, raven, imp, or similar, an intelligent little creature capable of speech, that goes with you everywhere and qualifies as a Bro.
